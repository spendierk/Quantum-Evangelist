<h1 id="pytket-bricks">PyTKET Bricks</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/spendierk/pytket-bricks">PyTKET bricks</a> were designed as an educational resource to provide a hands-on and fun way to assemble well-known quantum circuits. For example, the bricks can be assembled to represent a Bell State or Grover&#39;s algorithm example. </p>

<p>The brick design is based on the PyTKET circuit rendering tool, which offers both traditional quantum circuit design and ZX calculus design. The bricks can be designed after the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">H-gates, Z-gates, CX-gates, and CZ-gates,</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX-calculus">ZX calculus version with unitary maps and spiders</a> together with qubit zero (q[0]) and qubit one (q[1]) and wire pieces represented as straight lines.</p>
<p>PyTKET bricks can be enjoyed alone, with friends, or with family.</p>
