<p> I received my BS in Physics and Applied Mathematics with honors and my Ph.D. in Physics with distinction from the University of New Mexico. 
After a year as Research Associate, I joined the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) as a tenure-track faculty in Physics. 
I earned tenure at UCCS by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S3bNbmMAAAAJ&hl=en">researching biophysical phenomena using super-resolution microscopy techniques and condensed matter physics</a>. 
At UCCS, I developed and taught numerous physics undergraduate and graduate courses. Currently, I am the Technical Prize Director for the XPRIZE Quantum Applications competition. 
  Before joining XPRIZE, Kathrin was a Quantum Computing Technology Evangelist at Quantinuum </p>
